# LOLCode
This code has been written and tested using the [lci (LOLCODE interpreter)](http://lolcode.org/), following the specifications of [LOLCODE v1.2](https://github.com/justinmeza/lolcode-spec/blob/master/v1.2/lolcode-spec-v1.2.md).

To execute it, one can use that interpreter (or another one that implements the same specifications) as follows: `lci Collatz.lol`, and input the initial number of the serie from stdin; or use `echo <number> | lci Collatz.lol`.
